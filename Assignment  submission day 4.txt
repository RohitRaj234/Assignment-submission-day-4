In this program, the user is asked to enter a positive integer. If the number is 0 or 1, it is not a prime number and the program displays an appropriate message. Otherwise, the program checks if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to n/2. If it is, then the flag variable is set to 1 and the loop is exited. If the flag is still 0 after the loop has finished, the number is prime. Otherwise, it is not prime.
